# Setting Up the Inventory (Admin Only)

NEW FEATURE

> [!WARNING]
> This guide is for administrator users. For non-admin staff members, skip to the [Checks](../inventory-maintenance/initiating-checks.md) user guides.

You can edit apparatus and warehouse details directly from the **Inventory** and **Maintenance** list and check pages. You can also set permissions to control which fields users can edit for apparatus/warehouse entries. Previously, this feature was available only in the Admin Back-Office.

The configuration process includes two stages:

1. Set up **Inventory and Maintenance Profile** permissions, as described in [Inventory & Maintenance Profiles (Back-Office)](./setting-up-the-inventory-admin-only/inventory-maintenance-profiles-back-office.md).
2. Edit Apparatus and Warehouse details on the web app, as described in [Apparatus/Warehouse Details (Web App)](./setting-up-the-inventory-admin-only/apparatuswarehouse-details-web-app.md).
