## Interface Overview

The **Inventory**, **Maintenance**, **Item Checks**, and **My Items** interfaces consolidate all check functions into an organized workspace. Understanding the check interface helps you navigate efficiently and complete checks accurately, saving time and ensuring all important information is properly documented.

The layout consists of a quick access menu, key information bar, and main workspace to manage item checks, inventory, and maintenance data efficiently.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**: The screens in the **Inventory**, **Maintenance**, **Item Checks**, and **My Items** interfaces vary. Since the workflows are similar, we unified their interface guides.

## Quick Access Menu

Everything you need is on the left side:

- Checks Summary
