## Overview

**Item Check** helps you track and document your equipment status. Before starting, ensure you have appropriate permissions, a stable internet connection, and familiarity with your item types and locations.

> **Note**: These procedures work for both **Item Check** and **My Items**. **Item Check** displays department equipment that needs tracking, while **My Items** shows your personal gear, making it easy to maintain both types of equipment using the same steps.
