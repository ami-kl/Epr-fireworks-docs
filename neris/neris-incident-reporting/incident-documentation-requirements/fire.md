# Documenting NERIS Fire Module

## Overview

The Fire tab in NERIS captures detailed information about fire incidents, including fire characteristics, suppression operations, and property losses. This module appears when you select a fire-related incident type during initial classification.

> [!WARNING]
> ### **Disclaimer**
> NERIS is currently under development by the Fire Safety Research Institute (FSRI). This guide reflects the system as implemented in EPR FireWorks. Functionality may evolve as NERIS continues development toward full national implementation by January 2026.

## Fire Module Components

The Fire module consists of two main sections:

### Fire (Characteristics and Operations)

This section documents the tactical aspects of the fire incident:

| **Field** | **Description** | **Options** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Nature of the Fire** | Classification of the fire type and behavior | - Outside Fire<br>- Structure Fire |
| **Suppression Appliances** | Equipment and tools used to combat the fire | - Air Tanker / Helitanker<br>- Booster (< 1 inch) Fire Hose<br>- Building Fire Department Connection<br>- Building Standpipe<br>- Elevated Master Stream<br>- Fire Extinguisher (All Agent Types)<br>- Ground Monitor<br>- Master Stream<br>- Medium Diameter (2 inch to 3 inch) Fire Hose<br>- None<br>- Other<br>- Small Diameter (1 inch to 2 inch) Fire Hose |
| **Water Supply** | Source and delivery method of water for suppression | - Draft from Static Source<br>- Foam / Water Additive<br>- Hydrant (Est. Flow < 500 GPM)<br>- Hydrant (Est. Flow > 500 GPM)<br>- Nurse from Other Apparatus<br>- Supply From Fire Boat<br>- Tank Water<br>- Water Tender / Shuttle |

### Estimated Dollar Value and Losses

This section documents the financial impact of the fire. All entries should be in USD:

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pre Property Value** | Estimated value of the structure before the incident |
| **Property Loss** | Estimated dollar value of structure damage |
| **Pre Content Value** | Estimated value of contents before the incident |
| **Content Loss** | Estimated dollar value of content damage |
