# Casualties & Rescues

# Overview

The **Casualties & Rescues** section documents injuries, fatalities, and rescues associated with an incident, ensuring comprehensive tracking of both firefighter and civilian impacts for NERIS reporting. This section is divided into two subsections: **Firefighter Casualties & Rescues** and **Civilian Casualties & Rescues**, each with a summary view to list entries. Clicking **Add** in either subsection opens the Casualty Details form, which captures detailed information about the casualty or rescue, including rescue circumstances, casualty specifics, and demographic data.
