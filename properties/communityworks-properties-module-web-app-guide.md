## Inspections (CW Inspections)

> [!NOTE]
> This section covers CW Inspections on FireWorks and Back-Office only. Before reading this section, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed Inspections.

The CW Inspections section consolidates all new Inspection requests and updates. All Inspection requests are separated into two categories: **New** and **In Progress**. These tabs appear on the **CommunityWorks** navigation bar under **Inspections**. In **New**, you can view all unapproved requests for new inspections. In **In Progress**, you can view all running inspections.

In this section, we will explain the following:

- Managing [new](#) and [in-progress](#) inspections.
- Managing Inspection types (Back-Office).

### New inspection requests

New requests for inspections come in from property owners through the CommunityWorks website. The following procedure describes how to view and approve new requests:

1. In CommunityWorks, go to Inspections. By default, CW Inspections opens in **New**.![image-20240818-085649.png](./attachments/image-20240818-085649.png)

4. The inspection page will open in a new tab. Review the details of the inspection and edit where necessary.
5. When finished, click **Save**.

### In Progress inspections

The **In progress** category consolidates all the unfinished inspections still awaiting violation fixes, rescheduled appointments, and more. **In progress** inspections are divided into two sections as follows:

- **Unread**: unviewed updates to inspection violations.
- **All the rest**: pending inspections still awaiting updates.

### Creating new inspection types

All inspections are categorized according to **Inspection Types**. **Inspection Types** are a required field whenever requesting a new inspection. Inspection-type management is done through the Back-Office.
