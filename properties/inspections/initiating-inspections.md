## Documenting Violations

Documenting violations is central to the inspection process. Violations are according to how each department chooses to operate using an inspection list.

To record violations, follow these steps:

1. Select the first category for inspection.![image-20250202-150705.png](./attachments/image-20250202-150705.png)
2. Mark the violations **OK**, **Not OK**, or **n/a** according to the application of the defined violations.  
**Note**: Violations in red are mandatory to complete.![image-20250202-150832.png](./attachments/image-20250202-150832.png)
  
**For departments with ‘Minor Violations’ enabled**: Violations that are deemed by the authority having jurisdiction as minor, do not generate a reinspection.![image-20250202-150906.png](./attachments/image-20250202-150906.png)
3. If you marked a violation as **Not OK**, expand the violation and complete the following fields:
1.   **Remarks**: Add remarks concerning the state of the violation. These remarks will appear on the final report.
2.   **Internal Remarks**: You can add internal remarks (optional) about the violation. These remarks will not appear on the report but will be kept in the inspection for future use.
3.   **Compliance**: This field is completed automatically according to the violation preset. If needed, add additional compliance information.
4.   **Location**: Enter the violation’s location.
5.   **Sub-Location**: If the violation’s location is hard to find, add a sub-location for further clarity.
6.   **Due Date**: The violation’s due date, as calculated by the system.
7.   If this is a reinspection, verify the following fields:
  
  -   **Correction Date**: The date when the violation was corrected. This field updates automatically during reinspection when a violation status changes to OK.
  
  -   **Corrected By**: The staff member who approved the correction. This field populates automatically during reinspection when a violation status changes to OK..
  
  -   **Actual Cost**: Add the final cost of the correction.
8.   If a citation was issued, select **Citation Issued** and complete the **Citation #** and **Citation Remarks** fields.
9.   Using the attachments icon, add pictures or documents regarding the violation.**Note**: Photos taken with the camera icon save directly to FireWorks cloud storage, not to your device. This feature works only in **Online** mode. If performing an inspection in **Offline** mode, you can add photos later when you reconnect to internet service, provided the images were saved to your device.![image-20250202-151106.png](./attachments/image-20250202-151106.png)
